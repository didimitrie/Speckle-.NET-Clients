# Installation Notes:

- Make sure you save your work and backup everything. Get insurance for your pet as well, Speckle might kill it. 

Ok, for real: 

- Make sure all the plugin files are in one separate folder, separate from other plugins you might have.
- Make sure you unblock all the dlls, etc. 
- Make sure you have an internet connection when you run. No internet no fun.
