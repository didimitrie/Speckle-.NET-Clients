# Installation Notes:

> Make sure you save your work and backup everything. Get insurance for your pet as well, Speckle might kill it. 

### 1. Download the .zip above & unzip it to its folder ("Extract to `AbstractSpeckle\`, make sure all .dlls and .ghas are in one folder).
### 2. Copy the `AbstractSpeckle` folder to the Grasshopper components folder. 
### 3. If necessary, unblock the dlls & ghas. 

# Startup: 

### 1. The components will show up in their own `Speckle` tab. 
### 2. The first time you will drag a Speckle Sender or Speckle Receiver on the canvas you will need to create a Speckle Account.
If you have deployed your own [Speckle Server](https://github.com/didimitrie/Speckle-Server), use its url. Otherwise, you can use `https://server.speckle.works` as a test server to register to. Input your email & password and hit register.
### 3. Everytime you will now create a new Speckle Sender or Speckle Receiver, a dialog prompt will ask you which Speckle Account to use. Old accounts will be remembered, so you can quickly select them. 

# Usage notes: 

- Speckle Senders have no default inputs. You will need to add them via the ZUI. 
- You can rename Speckle Senders. 
- You can rename any inputs you add to Speckle Senders.
